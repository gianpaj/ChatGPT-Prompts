# Chat GPT For Programming: 100+ Coding Prompts For Chat GPT

### OpenAI has created a powerful tool called ChatGPT, which uses vast amounts of text data to develop a language that sounds like it’s coming from a human. It can be used for things like translating languages and answering questions.


However, the incredible AI chatbot can, among other things, help programmers with their coding issues by generating solutions on the spot.

ChatGPT can write codes for free, but it’s best not to ask it to make up codes unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. Do not expect the model to do your work for you in its current form, as it is too new and naive, but it is upgrading and learning day by day.

ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for both finding errors in your own code and quickly generating simple coding programs. Instead of spending hours searching for solutions on Stack Overflow, ChatGPT can complete the task in minutes.

In any case, if you’re looking for a way to get your coding projects done 20 times faster, here are some of the best Chat GPT coding prompts you’ll find.
